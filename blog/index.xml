      <description>My Journey speeding up e-mails and ditching the MX Server I&amp;rsquo;ve had enough with shared hosting. For years our domain, Kostarelas.com has been on shared hosting provided by Godaddy.
Previously, I was too young to take control of the administration of the domain, but today was the last straw, thanks to two step verification.
I was setting up a service on a new device that of course asked for a 2 step verification code.</description>

      <description>After recently watching the film Parasite, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t get over the simple fact that it&amp;rsquo;s rather easy to mix noodle packets together. Why wasn&amp;rsquo;t I trying this sooner?
Deciding enough is enough, I jumped on the opportunity to make a combination of flavours some may deem strange, but feeling adventurous I grabbed two packets from the pantry and went to work.
My combo of choice; Chapagetti, a black bean style noodle, with Shin Ramyun, a sort of spicy soupy noodle.</description>

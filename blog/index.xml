Back to the original announcement, I remember the first time the address checker provided a date of installation. Delay after delay the day arrived, I&amp;rsquo;d have regular access to fast broadband.
Since then, so many innovations have changed the way we use technology on a daily basis. Having gone through a change in OS I was quickly thrust into the world of linux, homelabs and self hosting.</description></item><item><title>Journey into making Album Art covers</title><link>https://adam.kostarelas.com/blog/album-art/</link><pubDate>Mon, 31 May 2021 03:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://adam.kostarelas.com/blog/album-art/</guid><description>Ever since I got an iPod touch back in the late 2000s, a key design standout has been how Album art can provide bias to decide whether or not to listen to a song. It can also at times provide a &amp;lsquo;feeling&amp;rsquo; of the album. The feature i&amp;rsquo;m referring to of course is Cover flow:
During this lockdown in Melbourne, Victoria, I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to do a few pieces of digital art to refine my photoshop skills, and to see it as a way to try to understand the &amp;lsquo;feeling&amp;rsquo; of music.</description></item><item><title>Mac privacy feature you may not have heard of</title><link>https://adam.kostarelas.com/blog/mac-privacy-feature/</link><pubDate>Sat, 29 May 2021 06:08:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://adam.kostarelas.com/blog/mac-privacy-feature/</guid><description>Many people who use a new Macbook in &amp;ldquo;Clamshell mode&amp;rdquo; (lid closed, and connected to an external display) may inadvertently be familiar with this privacy feature.

For years our domain, Kostarelas.com has been on shared hosting provided by Godaddy.
Previously, I was too young to take control of the administration of the domain, but today was the last straw, thanks to two step verification.
I was setting up a service on a new device that of course asked for a 2 step verification code. Usually with platforms like Gmail, Outlook and fast SMTP servers, you&amp;rsquo;d get a push notification instantly.</description></item><item><title>Noodle Mix 1: Chapagetti and Shin Ramyun</title><link>https://adam.kostarelas.com/blog/noodle-mix-chapagetti-shin-ramyun/</link><pubDate>Sun, 12 Jul 2020 17:48:23 +1000</pubDate><guid>https://adam.kostarelas.com/blog/noodle-mix-chapagetti-shin-ramyun/</guid><description>After recently watching the film Parasite, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t get over the simple fact that it&amp;rsquo;s rather easy to mix noodle packets together. Why wasn&amp;rsquo;t I trying this sooner?
Deciding enough is enough, I jumped on the opportunity to make a combination of flavours some may deem strange, but feeling adventurous I grabbed two packets from the pantry and went to work.
My combo of choice; Chapagetti, a black bean style noodle, with Shin Ramyun, a sort of spicy soupy noodle.</description></item><item><title>:// Welcome</title><link>https://adam.kostarelas.com/blog/first-post/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Jul 2020 14:12:12 +1000</pubDate><guid>https://adam.kostarelas.com/blog/first-post/</guid><description>hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad(); Hey It&amp;rsquo;s only fair that I introduce myself.

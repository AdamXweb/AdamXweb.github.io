      <description>Trennial 2020 Visiting NGV has been close to the top of my to-do list of places to visit with the Melbourne lock-down slowly lifting.
This collection of photos are a few of the highlights on my visit.
The first feature is an animated work of art that uses a dataset of images of nature to base the colours of the mesmerising waves. Refik Anadol&amp;rsquo;s piece of art inspired me to add a new project to my list for a web based adaptation&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve had enough with shared hosting. For years our domain, Kostarelas.com has been on shared hosting provided by Godaddy.
Previously, I was too young to take control of the administration of the domain, but today was the last straw, thanks to two step verification.
I was setting up a service on a new device that of course asked for a 2 step verification code. Usually with platforms like Gmail, Outlook and fast SMTP servers, you&amp;rsquo;d get a push notification instantly.</description>

      <description>After recently watching the film Parasite, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t get over the simple fact that it&amp;rsquo;s rather easy to mix noodle packets together. Why wasn&amp;rsquo;t I trying this sooner?
Deciding enough is enough, I jumped on the opportunity to make a combination of flavours some may deem strange, but feeling adventurous I grabbed two packets from the pantry and went to work.
My combo of choice; Chapagetti, a black bean style noodle, with Shin Ramyun, a sort of spicy soupy noodle.</description>

# Trennial 2020

Visiting NGV has been close to the top of my to-do list, ever since everything in Melbourne closed with the lockdown.

It apparently is customary for the artists in their region to paint with ochres collected from the natural environment. With these pigments, they are ground on a stone, mixed with water and glue and then applied to the surfaces.

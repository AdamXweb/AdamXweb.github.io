## Hey

It's only fair that I introduce myself. I'm Adam, from Melbourne in Australia!
You'll find me working on a few tech related things, or building solutions for local businesses.
As of July 2020 I'm working on [Topre.design](https://topre.design) with Daniel Augoustakis to provide brand solutions at a full service capacity.

There are numerous smaller projects that i'm tackling during this COVID period also that I may post about.
The main areas which i'll be posting are:

- Food
- Code journey
- Brand journey
- General.

## My socials
If you're looking for constant content by me, I'm most active on [Instagram](https://instagram.com/adamxweb)
You can also find the source code for most of my projects on my [Github](https://github.com/AdamXweb)

P.S. Check back in Dark mode to see how awesome CSS is.
```
@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {<content>}
```


See you round!

It's easy to make life easier on your Mac with the aid of a few Mac Apps, as well as hidden features within MacOS. Here's a few suggestions.

## Better Touch Tool

### Drag windows around effortlessly

Instead of clicking and dragging the Instead of clicking and dragging the[title bar](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/macos/windows-and-views/window-anatomy/#title-bar "Apple HID title bar info") to move the window around, a simple trick is to turn on a keyboard shortcut. When your cursor hovers over a window, your press the button and easily move the window around, quickly and effortlessly.

I'd recommend using the fn key on Apple keyboards to move the window, as it's in the bottom left corner of the keyboard and makes it easy to quickly press.

On non-Apple keyboards like the one i'm currently using, i'd recommend the combination of shift and ctrl; both next to each other and easy to press also.

## Non Apple keyboard shortcuts

I've been using Apple keyboards, either on the MacBooks themselves, or on my external bluetooth keyboard for quite a few years, and the habit of wanting to press at the top left to control the volume is something I must be able to do.

## Use Hot Corners to make full use of your mouse.

If you're like me, I try to find efficiencies in the Operating System that i'm using. Examples of such is to be able to navigate as much through the OS as possible without the need of the second peripheral (Only using the mouse, or only using the keyboard).

A nifty feature called hot corners allows you to move the mouse to the edge of the screen

Hot Corners is found at the bottom left of Mission Control in System Preferences.

## Advanced keyboard usage with Alfred

Spotlight for me just hasn't been enough over the last few years. Sure, there have been improvements, however none of the improvements will be able to match third-party innovations.

A piece of software called [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/ "Alfred Website") allows for so much more control that Spotlight can't provide.

With Alfred, you can;

* Restart, shutdown or log out of your Mac
* Empty the trash
* Search for text within files
* DuckDuckGo a phrase right from search
* Control Music in iTunes (Apple Music)
* Type text, and press Command Option L to make it full screen to easily read.
* Easily find contact information
* Create a workflow
* So much more...

Keep in mind there are other great options out there aside from Alfred that can be more powerful. The downside is the time a user may need to configure the options may be too long for the average user.

The other option i'd recommend is [Lacona](https://lacona.app/ "Lacona Website"). It can be a bit more powerful understanding commands. Downside is that they only offer a subscription for their 'pro' features that can hook you into another thing to pay yearly..

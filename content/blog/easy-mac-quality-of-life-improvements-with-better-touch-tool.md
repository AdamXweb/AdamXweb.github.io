It's easy to make life easier on your Mac with the aid of Better Touch Tool. Here's a few suggestions.

## Drag windows around effortlessly

Instead of clicking and dragging the [title bar](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/macos/windows-and-views/window-anatomy/#title-bar "Apple HID title bar info") to move the window around, a simple trick is to turn on a keyboard shortcut. When your cursor hovers over a window, your press the button and easily move the window around, quickly and effortlessly.

I'd recommend using the fn key on Apple keyboards to move the window, as it's in the bottom left corner of the keyboard and makes it easy to quickly press.

On non-Apple keyboards like the one i'm currently using, i'd recommend the combination of shift and ctrl; both next to each other and easy to press also.

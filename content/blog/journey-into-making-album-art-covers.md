Ever since I got an iPod touch back in the late 2000s, a key standout to me has been how Album art can provide bias to decide whether or not to listen to a song. It can also at times provide a 'feeling' of the album.

During this lockdown in Melbourne, Victoria, I've decided to do a few pieces of digital art to refine my photoshop skills, and to see it as a way to try to understand the 'feeling' of music.

I do understand that a lot of my art is unrefined. The challenge I'm undertaking is to spend an hour on a composition based on a song e.g. the title, the feeling listening to it etc.

I'll be updating the progress on my [Instagram](https://instagram.com/adamxweb)

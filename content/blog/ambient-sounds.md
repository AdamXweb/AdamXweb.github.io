I like the idea of sitting in a workspace with headphones on whilst listening to ambient sounds.
Picture this; low chatter, mugs clinking, steam, birds chirping. I instantly think of a coffee shop. It is generally known that the act of meditation provides a more positive mindset.
My spin on the typical audioscape is to record and playback some sounds closer to home.

This includes:
- Rain
- Native birds
- National parks
- Ocean sounds
and more..

Working from home on a nice sunny day can be great, however when there's limited time to go outside, the sound of native birds, a park or other sounds can help to immerse someone to feel like they're outside to boost productivity.

My plan is to release a few of these tracks on SoundCloud. You can comment below or get in touch if you are interested in the 192khz 24 bit versions.

My gear includes:
- Tascam DR 100 miii
- 2x Clippy XLR EM272
- Rycote Windjammers
- Zoom H1
- iPhone 13 Pro

Tracks will be tagged with the relevant gear!

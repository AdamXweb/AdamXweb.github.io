This innovative feature occurs when you close your Macbook&amp;rsquo;s lid. The microphone is then disconnected at a hardware level.

For years our domain, Kostarelas.com has been on shared hosting provided by Godaddy.
Previously, I was too young to take control of the administration of the domain, but today was the last straw, thanks to two step verification.
